# Smart Helper for Academic Revision and Practice (SHARP)

## Overview

This project is an initiative in the education sector aimed at transforming how O-Level students prepare for exams. Initially envisioned in January 2024, it has evolved into a feasible and promising solution to aid students in mastering their subjects effectively.

## Project Description

The Smart Helper for Academic Revision and Practice is an AI-powered preparation tool designed specifically for O-Level Computer Science students. It utilizes advanced AI techniques, including a multi-agent framework, to:

Provide students with topic- and difficulty-wise sorted past paper questions.

Facilitate targeted practice for specific topics.

Offer personalized support and guidance using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) assistant that mimics the support of a real teacher.

## Problem Statement

O-Level Computer Science students, especially beginners, face a significant challenge: the lack of topic-sorted past papers in the market (as of 2024 publications). This gap makes it difficult for students to focus their practice on specific areas where they need improvement.

The Smart Helper addresses this gap by:

Organizing past paper questions into topical categories with varying difficulty levels.

Offering a GenAI-driven RAG assistant to guide students in solving questions and provide explanations, replicating the personalized attention of a teacher.

## Vision

To empower students with a comprehensive, AI-driven learning tool that bridges the gap between traditional resources and modern, adaptive learning methodologies, enabling them to achieve academic success with confidence.
